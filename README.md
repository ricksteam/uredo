## CommandExecutor

Class that implements an undo/redo stack.
To use, pass an object to the do function that has at least two paramaterless functions, do() and undo().
If the object have a member variable includeWithPrevious set to true, the undo and redo stack will treat 
command as an incremental command that should be done/redone with the previous command.

### do

Execute a command and place it on the undo stack. Also clears the redo stack()

#### Parameters

-   `command` **[object][8]** An object with two parameterless functions, do() and undo()

### undo

Pop the last item on the undo stack, call its undo function, and push it on the redo stack. 
Throws an error if there is no undo stack.
If the last object was the includeWithPrevious flag set, it will undo the previous command
until the undo stack is empty or a command is found without the includeWithPrevious or a command
with that flag set to false.

### redo

Pop the last item off the redo stack, call its do() functions, and push it on the undo stack.
Throws an error if there is no redo stack.
If the following object(s) have the includeWithPrevious flag set, it will redo the following commands
until the redo stack is empty or a command is found with the includeWithPrevious flag or a command 
with that flag set to false.

### canUndo

Check to see if the undo stack has at least one object.

### canRedo

Check to see if the redo stack has at least one object.
